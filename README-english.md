## Preface
Do you ever feel frustrated when using Windows? Perhaps you're accustomed to the Windows interface, or maybe you choose Windows because its ecosystem is stronger than Linux's. However, you might find yourself uncomfortable with commands like `dir` and `del`, longing for the concise Linux-style commands—this is exactly the frustration I've experienced.

That's why I developed this program: **to enable the use of bash commands on Windows!**
